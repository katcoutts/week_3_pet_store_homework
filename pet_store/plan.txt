BUILDING SIMPLE PET SHOP


Relationship between pet store and pet is many to one. A pet store has many pets but a pet is only in one pet store.
Always model in the singular.

PetStore:
Name 
ID

Pet:
Name
Type 
ID

1 Initial setup
- DB
-Directory

NEED TO REMEMBER TO RUN THIS WHICH IS SETTING UP THE SCAFFOLDING ONCE YOU'VE CREATED THE DATABASE AND CREATED THE TABLES.
psql -d pet_store -f db/pet_store.sql

2 Construct basic models
- PetStore
- Pet
- In each class we'll create methods that allow us to talk to the database
- Create a console script

3 Write relationship methods (ie things like a method so you could get the names of the albums an artist has)
- store.pets()
- pet.stores()


HOMEWORK

Pet Store

You have been asked to create an app that will allow the owner of a Pet Store chain manage their stores and stock(pets).

They would like to be able to:

Create and Save Pet Stores
Create and Save Pets

List all the pets of a store

Show the store a pet belongs to
Every pet store should have a name, a 1 line address and a stock type e.g "exotic". Pets should have a name, and a type.

Additionally it would be nice to be able to:

Find Pet Stores by their ID
Edit Pet Stores
Delete Pet Stores
List All Pet Stores

Find Pets by their ID

Edit Pets
Delete Pets
List All Pets
